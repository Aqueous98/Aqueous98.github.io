          <h3>List of Technologies</h3>
        <h4>Iron Giant: Machine Vision</h4>
        <p>Machine vision is a topic of note because it is one of the many features of the Iron Giant. While machine vision is an 
          emerging technology in the real world, the machine vision technology within the Iron Giant is highly advanced. 
          The Iron Giant’s machine vision features facial recognition, weapon recognition, and targeting.
        </p>
	      <p>The Iron Giant’s facial recognition is quite accurate because it is able to determine who Hogarth is along with other 
          characters within the movie. This is on par with the level of facial recognition technology that we have today. 
          In 2014, facebook’s “DeepFace” algorithms had a facial recognition accuracy of 97.25% accuracy. Regarding the Iron Giant’s
          weapon recognition, it is able to accurately able to detect a weapon to which it then goes into a defense mode and tries 
          to protect himself. Compared to the real world, the Iron Giant’s weapon detection technology would rival that of 
          PatriotOne Technologies, a weapons defense company. The PatriotOne offers what they call, a Cognitive Microwave Radar 
          (CMR) which is capable of scanning patterns and comparing them to that of weapon patterns that have been uploaded into 
          the system. With each scan, the CMR is able to learn and remember patterns of scanned and confirmed weapons so that it 
          will ultimately improve the accuracy of its system. In addition to the weapon recognition, when in need of other defense, 
          the Iron Giant is also equipped with a high performance targeting system. While its system is high performance, it is not
          perfect. This is seen in the movie when Hogarth distracts the Iron Giant and it misses its shot on the battleship. In the 
          living world, we are working on technology that is reasonably more accurate. TrackingPoint, a weapons company, has designed 
          what the they call “Precision-Guided Firearms.” The company uses a fire control system called TriggerLink that virtually 
          eliminates human error caused by misaiming, mistiming, and nervous system jitters. The system recognizes the object that 
          you want to shoot creating a crosshair for you to lock on to. When you lock on, the system uses precise measurements to 
          snap your crosshairs to the point of impact.
        </p>
        <h4>Iron Giant: Swarm Robotics</h4>
        <p>The Iron Giant has shown multiple accounts of breaking up into smaller components of itself. Each piece capable of acting 
          as its own, This phenomenon is known as swarm robotics. There are two systems that are used by a swarm: group independence 
          and hierarchy. Group independence is an action similar to that found in ant colonies where no one entity has authority over 
          another, but they work together to complete an objective bigger than themselves. Group independence has the benefit where a 
          swarm of this type can adapt to a change in their numbers. On the other hand, a hierarchy swarm has a queen bot that commands 
          lesser robots called workers. These workers in turn command lesser robots called scouts which carry a lot of the labor. 
          This is very similar to that found in the Iron Giant. Its head acts as a queen, signaling the other parts to return. 
          Large components such as hands and legs are complicated and act as their own capable entity. It can be inferred that 
          these are the worker bots, while smaller pieces such as his screw are scouts. There are two methods that can affect a 
          swarms integrity: invasive robots and targeted takedowns. Group independence has the downside of being vulnerable by 
          introducing an invasive robot. By taking a member of the swarm and reprogramming it, its false information and objectives 
          can cause the swarm to fail as a whole because of the easy assimilation. Hierarchy does not suffer from this because it has 
          tiers of authority however, by taking out just the queen robot, the swarm is shut down entirely. This was not attempted in
          the film, but the possibility is still there.
        </p>
        <h4>Iron Giant: Computational Power</h4>
        <p>When it comes to running complicated systems such as machine learning and AI, there is a heavy emphasis on required 
          components to make them operate correctly. Semiconductors such as CPUs and GPUs are essential for these tasks. GPUs run data 
          through multiple cores in parallel which is very useful at calculating large identical matrix multiplication in machine 
          learning. Assuming that the Iron Giant is as intelligent as a human (given that he shows creativity, adaptability, emotions, 
          understanding, and more humanlike qualities) it would take an enormous amount of power to run its “brain”. For reference In 
          2013, it took 40 minutes for the K Computer, which runs at about 10.5 petaflops per second, to simulate a second of human 
          brain activity. Just to run and cool this machine required about 12.6 megawatts of electricity. This requires a mid size 
          solar power plant station just to supply this.
        </p>
        <h4>Iron Giant: Machine Learning and General Artificial Intelligence</h4>
        <p>The most current version of machine learning is based off of analysing large datasets and applying those datasets to a 
          learning model to train the model [1]. However the Iron Giant appears to learn with few examples and seems to be able to 
          infer beyond his knowledge domain. He learned what a rock is very quickly and with only 2 examples, this is not possible 
          using only our current understanding of machine learning which implies that the Iron Giant does not solely learn through 
          machine learning but also through some form of inference system that applies common sense--such an inference system is 
          known in computer science as general artificial intelligence. The most advanced general logic and inference system currently 
          is the Cyc project which currently is still in development and has been since 1984 [2][3]. The Cyc project is still limited 
          to being an expert system in actual application--an expert system still has a limited domain
        </p>
        <h4>Sputnik</h4>
        <p>Built and launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, Sputnik was the first manmade satellite to orbit the Earth. It did so for 
          about two months, broadcasting radio signals. This caused a significant amount of distress in the United States, since the 
          country did not have the technology to perform a similar feat. Additionally, the satellite’s multiple crossings over the 
          United States and radio transmissions caused both citizens and the government to fear that Soviet Russia might be able to 
          create a satellite to spy on them. (https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-02.html)
        </p>
        <h4>Computer Guided Nuclear Missiles</h4>
        <p>In the movie, the military calls in the launch of a guided nuclear missile from a submarine to attack the Iron Giant. 
          The technology to perform this feat has existed since 1955, which was the first deployment of the Regulus-1, the United 
          States’ first functional cruise missile. (A cruise missile is any computer guided missile that flies through the low 
          atmosphere to hit a grounded target). The Regulus was in service on aircraft carriers and submarines from 1955 to 1964, 
          so it is likely (given that The Iron Giant takes place in 1957), that the Regulus is the missile depicted.

        <h3>Class Topics</h3>
        <h4>Networked Communications</h4>
        <p>During the time when The Iron Giant takes place, late 1957, much of what we consider networked communications, with the 
          related issues we discussed in class, was not yet invented. The technological communication most present in the film is 
          radio, used by the soldiers to call in a missile strike, as well as Sputnik, which merely broadcasted a test signal carrying 
          little information on its own.
        </p>
        <h4>Intellectual Property</h4>
        <p>The Iron Giant is alien and therefore could not be patented copyrighted or trademarked [4]. If someone were to invent a way 
          to produce an Iron Giant that process could be patented [4]. If the Iron Giant were used by a business that business could
          have the Iron Giant’s involvement be a trade secret [5].
        </p>
        <h4>Information Privacy</h4>
        <p>Throughout the film, the iron giant displays usage of facial recognition in order to distinguish. The technology necessary 
          for this exists today, and has already begun to create privacy concerns. Companies like Facebook can and do use facial 
          recognition to build a template of someone’s actions and habits by recognizing their faces in uploaded photos. Another form 
          of privacy concern exhibited in The Iron Giant is the possibility of being spied upon by a foreign government. After Sputnik 
          was launched, people worried that satellite technology could be used by the Soviet Union to gather information about America. 
          Sputnik crossed over the United States four times, and broadcasted a radio signal that almost anyone with a receiver could 
          listen to, making the threat seem more real.

        <p>https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/partners/aol/special/sputnik/sput-02.html</p>
        <h4>Privacy and the Government</h4>
        <p>Throughout the entire film, the government is seen abusing their power and making bold attempts to invade the privacy of 
          civilians. During Mansley’s attempts to locate the iron giant, he invades Hogarth’s privacy by attempting to listen in on a 
          phone call. This is a blatant disregard for the privacy of Hogarth and his family. Adding to this, The Government shows up to 
          Dean’s house unannounced and without a warrant.
        </p>
        <h4>Computer and Network Security</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the list of technologies, the security of the iron giant is vulnerable as a result of its hierarchy like 
          swarm pattern. By eliminating its head, the whole swarm would collapse. This was not used or seen in the movie, however in 
          real life developing efficient swarm patterns is not just difficult in terms of execution but also in securing the system 
          communication. An inferred metaphor in the film also brought light upon network security within government organizations. 
          When Kent grabbed the radio from the General and demanded for a missile attack from the USS Nautilus, his order was assumed 
          to be coming from someone higher up as a result of the limited number of people who have access to the radio. Although 
          government systems may seem failproof, it is evident that because humans run these systems, there is no 100% protection from 
          security breaches.
        </p>
        <h4>Computer Reliability</h4>
        <p>In the movie, the iron giant malfunctions and forgets all his prior programing. Computers which are critical to people’s 
          lives and which have the direct capacity to kill people already exist [6][7]. Drones which have the ability to kill without 
          human intervention are not yet in use, but they are technically feasible and their lack of deployment is more a matter of 
          trust than ability [7].
